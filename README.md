# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

I have added the javascript code to create a password generator. This site allows a user to select their password criteria using the alert prompts. Based on the criteria selected a password will be generated with random characters.

* Users can choose the length of their password between a min of 8 and max of 128 characters

* Users can choose between including uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers for their password


## Installation

Here is the link to view the password generator website page:

Start by clicking the Generate button and then follow the instructions in the window prompt in order to generate a password.
